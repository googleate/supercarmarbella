The Ferrari 488 GTB opens a new chapter in the history of the eight-cylinder brand of the 'Prancing Horse'. This new berlinetta perfectly combines Ferrari's experience in F1 and in the 'WEC' ('World Endurance Championship'), where the 458 GT maintains the title of World Champion and has won its category in the last two editions of the 24 hours of Le Mans.

In this way, the new Ferrari 488 GTB fully exploits the 'know-how' acquired by Ferrari mechanics in the last decade through the XX program, which offers unique extreme cars on the track only to a limited group of testers. The 488 GTB is powered by the new 3902 cubic centimeter V8 engine that delivers 670CV at 8,000 revolutions and offers a maximum torque of 760 Nm. It accelerates from 0 to 200 km / h in 8.3 seconds and is capable of making a quick lap of the Fiorano track in one minute and twenty-three seconds. Its sound has also been optimized by Ferrari engineers. Designed in the 'Ferrari Styling Center', the Ferrari 488 GTB stands out for its sculptural sidewalls. Its air intake is a nod to the original 308 GTB. The wide front spoiler includes a double profile to improve the thermal efficiency of the radiators located on both sides. For their part, the circular LED lights have also been redesigned. Inside, the driving position is designed around the driver. The graphics and interface of the infotainment display have also been completely redesigned, while the design of the new Ferrari 488 GTB key is inspired by the car's cylinder block and allows keyless starting.
