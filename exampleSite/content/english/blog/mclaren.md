The McLaren P1 is a 1.20 meter high supercar that enters the scene to make the Ferrari LaFerrari and the Porsche 918 Spyder pale. It equips an electric motor of 179CV and 260 Nm that McLaren has incorporated together with the block V8 of 3.8 liters, twin turbo and 737CV. 

The two mechanics, together, reach 916CV, and when they work in unison they are impressive: 2.8 seconds from 0 to 100 km / h, 6.8 to reach 200 km / h and, 16.5 seconds later, it exceeds the 300 km / h. But they are only figures. It matters much more how the pilot feels: like spinning the drum of a washing machine in spin mode. Those who do not like roller coasters better refrain: getting behind the wheel of the McLaren P1 requires cold blood and nerves of steel. 

> Fuel: 16L/100Km Plugin Hybrid

> Power: 737HP  
> Price: 1.047.000€  
> Rent: 3000€/Day  
> Deposit: 6000€

As a plug-in hybrid that it is, it can circulate only in electric mode, with a range of ten kilometers, 160 km / h of maximum speed and 8.4 seconds to go from 0 to 100 km / h. In addition, its official consumption circulating in hybrid mode is 8.3 liters per hundred kilometers, with CO2 emissions of only 198 grams. But not only is the push it offers enormous, but how it transmits it to the road: it sticks to the asphalt in such a way that this McLaren is a dream come true for any lover of driving. 

The McLaren P1 goes down in the annals of motoring history as one of the most avant-garde and fastest cars of its time, ours, thanks to the extraordinary performance of its hybrid powertrain and its efficient set-up. In fact, it is present among the fastest production cars that go from 0 to 100 km / h of all time, despite being a propulsion vehicle.
